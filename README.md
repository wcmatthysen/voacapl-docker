# voacapl-docker
Docker runner script for VOACAP in Linux
(see: [jawatson/voacapl](https://github.com/jawatson/voacapl)).

By making use of docker, we can have an isolated container that allows us to execute
VOACAP commands without polluting our Linux system's environment with build-tools or
files and symlinks related to voacapl.

# Usage
To initialize the environment just run `./voacapl`. This will pull the docker-image
and fetch the *run* and *areadata* directories from the *jawatson/voacapl* repository.

For subsequent invocations you can run the command as you would normally run the
`voacapl` command. However, keep in mind that the *itshfbc* folder is now located
inside the docker-container in the voacap user's home directory
(i.e. */home/voacap/itshfbc*).

So, to do a point-to-point calculation you can run the following command:

```bash
./voacapl /home/voacap/itshfbc voacapx.dat voacapx-out.dat
```

This will invoke the `voacapl` command inside the container, specifying that it should
use */home/voacap/itshfbc* as the VOACAP runtime directory. The *voacapx.dat* file is
specified as input file for the command. This file is available to the container's
`voacapl` command because the *run* directory is mounted as a volume in the container
at */home/voacap/itshfbc/run*. Any output written to the *run* directory is then available
to the host as well. This means that you'll see the output file *voacapx-out.dat* being
written to the *run* directory.

To do an area-based calculation you can run the following command:

```bash
./voacapl /home/voacap/itshfbc area calc default/default.voa
```

This works similarly to the abovementioned point-to-point command. However, the input
file is read from the *areadata* instead of the *run* directory. In this case, the
input file is located in the *default* sub-directory of the *areadata* directory.
The output file will then be written to the same directory (*areadata/default*) with
a matching filename, and only the extension being changed to *vg1*.
